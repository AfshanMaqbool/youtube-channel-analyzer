Handling Outliers:\n","   - For `channel_df_real`, the 'subscriber_count' outlier was intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, outliers in numerical columns were intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Capping was intended to reduce the influence of extreme values without removing data points, which is beneficial for small datasets.\n","\n","3. Standardization:\n","   - Numerical columns in both `channel_df_real` and `video_df_real` were standardized using StandardScaler. (Applied to available numerical columns).\n","   - Rationale: Standardization scales numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance, which is important for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features.\n","\n","4. Categorical Encoding:\n","   - Categorical columns in `channel_df_real` ('country', 'age_group') were intended to be one-hot encoded. (Applied if columns are present).\n","   - Rationale: One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, creating binary columns for each category.

Handling Missing Values:\n","   - For `channel_df_real`, missing 'country' values were intended to be imputed using the mode. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, missing numerical values were intended to be imputed using the median. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Imputation was chosen over removal due to the potential for small datasets to retain as much information as possible. Mode is suitable for categorical features, and median for numerical features affected by outliers.\n","\n","2. Handling Outliers:\n","   - For `channel_df_real`, the 'subscriber_count' outlier was intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, outliers in numerical columns were intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Capping was intended to reduce the influence of extreme values without removing data points, which is beneficial for small datasets.\n","\n","3. Standardization:\n","   - Numerical columns in both `channel_df_real` and `video_df_real` were standardized using StandardScaler. (Applied to available numerical columns).\n","   - Rationale: Standardization scales numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance, which is important for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features.\n","\n","4. Categorical Encoding:\n","   - Categorical columns in `channel_df_real` ('country', 'age_group') were intended to be one-hot encoded. (Applied if columns are present).\n","   - Rationale: One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, creating binary columns for each category. 'handle_unknown='ignore'' is used to manage unseen categories during potential future transformations.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"47ea7ceb"},"source":["## Feature engineering\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Create relevant features from the raw data that can be used for analysis (e.g., video length, engagement rate, topic categories).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8d977695"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","Calculate engagement rate, extract number of tags, calculate description length, and consider interaction terms for the video_df.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"22963215","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755943994201,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":49,"user":{"displayName":"Afshan Maqbool","userId":"06291306370448794567"}},"outputId":"4a22097f-c7df-43b4-e141-9798410faedb"},"source":["# 1.

The strategy should prioritize creating more content in this style, ensuring it resonates with the dominant audience demographics (18-24 and 25-34 in the USA).\n","*   Implement the proposed evaluation framework by tracking defined KPIs, collecting ongoing data, and conducting regular analysis to iteratively refine the content strategy and audience engagement tactics based on real-world performance.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"59af6ec7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755943660975,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Afshan Maqbool","userId":"06291306370448794567"}},"outputId":"672f1b6d-9080-4435-89a2-c9f96bfc9886"},"source":["# Assuming 'youtube' service object is already built and 'video_ids' list is populated from the previous step (cell 5a64df6c)\n","\n","# Check if video_ids is defined and not empty before proceeding\n","if 'video_ids' not in locals() or not video_ids:\n","    print(\"Error: 'video_ids' is not defined or is empty.

(This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, missing numerical values were intended to be imputed using the median. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Imputation was chosen over removal due to the potential for small datasets to retain as much information as possible. Mode is suitable for categorical features, and median for numerical features affected by outliers.\n","\n","2. Handling Outliers:\n","   - For `channel_df_real`, the 'subscriber_count' outlier was intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, outliers in numerical columns were intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Capping was intended to reduce the influence of extreme values without removing data points, which is beneficial for small datasets.\n","\n","3. Standardization:\n","   - Numerical columns in both `channel_df_real` and `video_df_real` were standardized using StandardScaler. (Applied to available numerical columns).\n","   - Rationale: Standardization scales numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance, which is important for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features.\n","\n","4. Categorical Encoding:\n","   - Categorical columns in `channel_df_real` ('country', 'age_group') were intended to be one-hot encoded. (Applied if columns are present).\n","   - Rationale: One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, creating binary columns for each category. 'handle_unknown='ignore'' is used to manage unseen categories during potential future transformations.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","print(\"\\nPreprocessing Documentation:\")\n","print(preprocessing_documentation)\n","\n","\n","# Feature engineering\n","# This cell creates new features based on the raw data.\n","# It will operate on video_df_real.\n","\n","print(\"\\nStarting Feature Engineering...\")\n","\n","# Ensure video_df_real has the necessary columns before attempting feature engineering\n","required_cols_for_fe = ['viewCount', 'likeCount', 'commentCount', 'tags', 'description', 'average_view_duration']\n","if not video_df_real.empty and all(col in video_df_real.columns for col in required_cols_for_fe):\n","    # 1.

Handling Missing Values:\n","   - For `channel_df_real`, missing 'country' values were intended to be imputed using the mode. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, missing numerical values were intended to be imputed using the median. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Imputation was chosen over removal due to the potential for small datasets to retain as much information as possible. Mode is suitable for categorical features, and median for numerical features affected by outliers.\n","\n","2. Handling Outliers:\n","   - For `channel_df_real`, the 'subscriber_count' outlier was intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - For `video_df_real`, outliers in numerical columns were intended to be capped at the 95th percentile. (This step would require actual data).\n","   - Rationale: Capping was intended to reduce the influence of extreme values without removing data points, which is beneficial for small datasets.\n","\n","3. Standardization:\n","   - Numerical columns in both `channel_df_real` and `video_df_real` were standardized using StandardScaler. (Applied to available numerical columns).\n","   - Rationale: Standardization scales numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance, which is important for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features.\n","\n","4. Categorical Encoding:\n","   - Categorical columns in `channel_df_real` ('country', 'age_group') were intended to be one-hot encoded. (Applied if columns are present).\n","   - Rationale: One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, creating binary columns for each category. 'handle_unknown='ignore'' is used to manage unseen categories during potential future transformations.\n","\n","\n","Starting Feature Engineering...\n","\n","Skipping Feature Engineering: video_df_real is empty or missing required columns.\n","\n","Starting Data Analysis...\n","First few rows of channel_df_processed:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                 channel_id  subscriber_count  country age_group\n","0  UC_x5XG1OV2P6wZZ5ZFhpAlk               0.0  Unknown   Unknown"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-40892e49-0284-4cbe-8a9f-b73a91239faa\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>channel_id</th>\n","      <th>subscriber_count</th>\n","      <th>country</th>\n","      <th>age_group</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>UC_x5XG1OV2P6wZZ5ZFhpAlk</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>Unknown</td>\n","      <td>Unknown</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-40892e49-0284-4cbe-8a9f-b73a91239faa')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-40892e49-0284-4cbe-8a9f-b73a91239faa button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

The project covers key steps from data collection using the YouTube Data API to data preprocessing, analysis, and strategy formulation.\n","\n","**Note:** This notebook is designed as a template and requires you to insert your own YouTube Data API key and the link to the channel you wish to analyze to fetch real data. The current version includes placeholder data handling to allow the notebook to run end-to-end even without live API data.\n","\n","## Features\n","\n","*   **Data Collection:** Outlines how to use the YouTube Data API to collect channel and video statistics (requires API key).\n","*   **Input Handling:** Accepts a YouTube channel link as input and extracts the channel ID.\n","*   **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and prepare the collected data, handling missing values and outliers.\n","*   **Feature Engineering:** Creates relevant features for analysis, such as engagement rate and content characteristics.\n","*   **Data Analysis:** Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.\n","*   **Topic Modeling:** Applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to understand content themes from video titles, descriptions, and tags (requires sufficient video data).\n","*   **Strategy Generation:** Synthesizes findings from the analysis to propose actionable recommendations for content, audience engagement, and growth.\n","*   **Evaluation Framework:** Defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and outlines a process for evaluating and refining the generated strategy.\n","\n","## Getting Started\n","\n","### Prerequisites\n","\n","*   A Google Account to use Google Colab.\n","*   A YouTube Data API v3 key. If you don't have one, you can obtain it from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).\n","*   Access to Google Colab.\n","\n","### Setup and Installation\n","\n","1.  **Open the Notebook:** Upload or open the `your_notebook_name.ipynb` file in Google Colab.\n","2.  **Install Libraries:** Run the cell containing the `pip install google-api-python-client` command to install the necessary library. This should be done automatically if you run the notebook sequentially.\n","3.  **Provide API Key:** Go to the code cell where the `API_KEY` variable is defined (look for the comment \"Replace with your actual API key\"). Replace the placeholder value with your actual YouTube Data API key. **Be careful not to share your API key publicly if you make the repository public.**\n","4.  **Provide Channel Link:** Go to the code cell in the \"Input handling\" section that has a text input field labeled `# @title Paste the YouTube channel link here:`. Paste the full URL of the YouTube channel you want to analyze in this field.\n","\n","## Running the Notebook\n","\n","Once you have provided your API key and the channel link, you can run the notebook sequentially from top to bottom.\n","\n","*   Each section corresponds to a stage in the analysis and strategy generation pipeline.\n","*   Review the markdown cells for explanations and reasoning.\n","*   Run the code cells to execute the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps.\n","*   Pay attention to the output of the data collection cells to ensure data is being fetched from the API. If not, double-check your API key and the channel link.\n","\n","## Notebook Structure\n","\n","The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n","\n","1.  **Task:** Defines the overall goal.\n","2.  **Define the scope:** Clarifies what aspects of the channel will be analyzed.\n","3.  **Data collection:** Steps to collect data using the YouTube Data API.\n","4.  **Data preprocessing and cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, standardization, and encoding.\n","5.  **Feature engineering:** Creating new features from the raw data.\n","6.  **Data analysis:** Exploratory data analysis and visualizations.\n","7.  **Model selection:** Choosing appropriate analytical techniques.\n","8.  **Model development:** Building and training models (e.g., Topic Modeling).\n","9.  **Strategy generation:** Formulating recommendations based on analysis.\n","10. **Evaluation and refinement:** Outlining the process for evaluating and improving the strategy.\n","11. **UI placeholder:** Discussion on user input handling.\n","12. **Github preparation:** Steps for preparing the notebook for sharing.\n","13. **Github sharing:** Instructions for creating a repository and uploading files.\n","14. **Summary:** Key findings and next steps.\n","\n","## Contributing\n","\n","If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your suggested improvements.\n","\n","## License\n","\n","[Choose and Add Your License Here - e.g., MIT License]\n","\n","---"]}]}
